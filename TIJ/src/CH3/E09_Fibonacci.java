/****************** Exercise 9 **********************
 * A Fibonacci sequence is the sequence of numbers 1,
 * 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc., where each
 * number (from the third on) is the sum of the previous
 * two. Create a method that takes an integer as an
 * argument and displays that many Fibonacci numbers
 * starting from the beginning. If, e.g., you run java
 * Fibonacci 5 (where Fibonacci is the name of the
 * class) the output will be: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.
