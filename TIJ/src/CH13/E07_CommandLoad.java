/****************** Exercise 7 ******************
 * Modify SweetShop.java so that each type of
 * object creation is controlled by a
 * command-line argument. That is, if your
 * command line is "java SweetShop Candy," then
 * only the Candy object is created. Notice how
 * you can control which Class objects are loaded
 * via the command-line argument.
