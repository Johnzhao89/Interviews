/****************** Exercise 14 ******************
 * Create three interfaces, each with two methods.
 * Inherit a new interface from each, adding
 * a new method. Use the new interface to create
 * a class, and inherit from a concrete class.
 * Now write four methods, each of which takes one
 * of the four interfaces as an argument. Create
 * an object of your class in main(), and pass it
 * to each of the methods.
