/****************** Exercise 17 ******************
 * Move the Gerbil class from Exercise 1
 * into a Map, and associate each Gerbil (the value)
 * with it's name as a String (the key).
 * Use an Iterator for the keySet() to move
 * through the Map, look up the Gerbil for each key,
 * print out the key, and tell the Gerbil to hop().
