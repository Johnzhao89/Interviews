/****************** Exercise 4 ******************
 * Create a generator class that produces String objects
 * with the names of characters from your favorite
 * movie each time you call next(), and then loops
 * around to the beginning of the character list
 * when it runs out of names. Use this generator to
 * fill an array, an ArrayList, a LinkedList, a
 * HashSet, a LinkedHashSet, and a TreeSet, then
 * print each container.
