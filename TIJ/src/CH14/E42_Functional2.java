/****************** Exercise 42 *****************
 * Create two separate classes, with nothing in
 * common. Each class should hold a value, and at
 * least have methods that produce that value and
 * perform a modification upon that value. Modify
 * Functional.java so that it performs functional
 * operations on collections of your classes (these
 * operations do not have to be arithmetic as they
 * are in Functional.java).
