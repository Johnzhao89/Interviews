/****************** Exercise 34 *****************
 * Create a self-bounded generic type that contains
 * an abstract method that takes an argument of the
 * generic type parameter and produces a return value
 * of the generic type parameter. In a non-abstract
 * method of the class, call the abstract method and
 * return its result. Inherit from the self-bounded
 * type and test the resulting class.
