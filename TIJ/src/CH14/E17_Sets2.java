/****************** Exercise 17 *****************
 * Study the JDK documentation for EnumSet. You'll
 * see there's a clone() method.
 * However, you cannot clone() from the reference
 * to the Set interface passed in Sets.java. Can you
 * modify Sets.java to handle both the general case
 * of a Set interface as shown, and the special case
 * of an EnumSet, using clone() instead of creating
 * a new HashSet?
