/****************** Exercise 38 *****************
 * Look up the HashMap class in the JDK documentation.
 * Create a HashMap, fill it with elements, and
 * determine the load factor. Test the lookup speed
 * with this map, then attempt to increase the speed
 * by making a new HashMap with a larger initial
 * capacity and copying the old map into the new one,
 * then run your lookup speed test again on the new map.
