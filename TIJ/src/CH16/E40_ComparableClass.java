/****************** Exercise 40 *****************
 * Create a class containing two String objects
 * and make it Comparable so that the comparison
 * only cares about the first String. Fill an array
 * and an ArrayList with objects of your class,
 * using the RandomGenerator generator. Demonstrate that
 * sorting works properly. Now make a Comparator that
 * only cares about the second String, and demonstrate
 * that sorting works properly. Also perform a binary
 * search using your Comparator.
