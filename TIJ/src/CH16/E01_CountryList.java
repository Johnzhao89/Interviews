/****************** Exercise 1 ******************
 * Create a List (try both ArrayList and LinkedList)
 * and fill it using Countries. Sort the list and
 * print it, then apply Collections.shuffle() to the
 * list repeatedly, printing it each time so you
 * can see how the shuffle() method randomizes the
 * list differently each time.
