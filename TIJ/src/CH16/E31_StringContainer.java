/****************** Exercise 31 ******************
 * Create a container that encapsulates an array of
 * String, and that only allows adding Strings and
 * getting Strings, so that there are no casting
 * issues during use. If the internal array isn¡¯t big
 * enough for the next add, your container should
 * automatically resize it. In main(), compare the
 * performance of your container with an
 * ArrayList<String>.
