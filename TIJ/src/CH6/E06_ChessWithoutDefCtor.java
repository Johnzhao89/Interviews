/****************** Exercise 6 *****************
 * If you don¡¯t call the base-class constructor
 * in BoardGame(), the compiler will respond
 * that it can¡¯t find a constructor of the form
 * Game(). The call to the base-class
 * constructor must be the first thing you do
 * in the derived-class constructor. (The compiler
 * will remind you if you get it wrong.)
 * Use Chess.java to prove those assertions.
