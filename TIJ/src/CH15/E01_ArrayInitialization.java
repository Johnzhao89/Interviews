 * Create a method that takes an array of
 * BerylliumSphere as an argument. Call the method,
 * creating the argument dynamically. Demonstrate
 * that ordinary aggregate array initialization
 * doesn¡¯t work in this case. Discover the only
 * situations where ordinary aggregate array
 * initialization works, and where dynamic aggregate
 * initialization is redundant.
