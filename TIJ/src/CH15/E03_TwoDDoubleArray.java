/****************** Exercise 3 *****************
 * Write a method that creates and initializes a
 * two-dimensional array of double. The size of
 * the array is determined by the arguments of
 * the method, and the initialization values are
 * a range determined by beginning and ending
 * values that are also arguments of the method.
 * Create a second method that will print the
 * array generated by the first method. In main()
 * test the methods by creating and printing
 * several different sizes of arrays.
