/****************** Exercise 8 *****************
 * Following the form of the example Lunch.java,
 * create a class called ConnectionManager that
 * manages a fixed array of Connection objects.
 * The client programmer must not be able to
 * create Connection objects, but only get them
 * via a static method in ConnectionManager.
 * ConnectionManager returns a null reference when
 * it runs out of objects. Test the classes in main().
